# Text Classification Pipeline

A machine learning pipeline for classifying news articles into four categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech) using the [fancyzhx/ag_news](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fancyzhx/ag_news?row=2&fbclid=IwY2xjawI6YoNleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHSTM_lg9XiOtTpdj_7S_7xlHy-WQqF1ljeKtApc8FyCYgbTjFnRpT3S0Tg_aem_vtQpfcUcv-ZrxQfPN-94yQ) dataset. 

The **AG News** dataset serves as a robust benchmark for text classification, comprising thousands of news articles sourced from reputable outlets such as **Reuters** and **AP**.

The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction capabilities.

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py --task preprocess
python run.py --train naive_bayes
python run.py --predict naive_bayes
```

## Supported Models

- **Naive Bayes** (`naive_bayes`) - Fast baseline classifier
- **Decision Tree** (`decision_tree`) - Interpretable model
- **Neural Network** (`neural_network`) - MLP for complex patterns
- **Bayesian Network** (`bayesian_network`) - Probabilistic graphical model
- **Hidden Markov Model** (`hidden_markov_model`) - Sequential text classifier

## Command Reference
The main entry point for the pipeline is `run.py`, which provides a command-line interface to interact with the system.
```bash
python run.py [OPTIONS]
```
### Data Operations
- **Preprocess raw data**

```bash
python run.py --task preprocess
```

- **View dataset statistics**
```bash
python run.py --task review
```

### Model Operations
- **Train model** (saves to models/experiments/)
```bash
python run.py --train MODEL_NAME
```
- **Predict and Evaluate** model on test set
```bash
python run.py --predict MODEL_NAME
```
- **Test** model on custom examples
```bash
python run.py --test MODEL_NAME
```
## Pipeline Components

1. **Data Processing**
   - Loads AG News dataset
   - Maps labels to categories
   - Handles text normalization

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Text vectorization (TF-IDF/Count)
   - Feature selection optimization

3. **Model Training**
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Cross-validation
   - Model serialization

4. **Evaluation**
   - Metric: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score 
   - Confusion matrix visualization
   - Cross-validation reporting

## Performance Monitoring

The pipeline includes a timer utility that logs execution time for training and prediction tasks, helping to monitor model efficiency.

## Additional Notes

- Models are serialized using joblib for efficient storage and loading
- The system includes cross-validation to ensure model robustness
- Confusion matrices help visualize classification performance
 
## Example Workflow

### Training a New Model

```bash
# Process raw data (if not already done)
python run.py --task preprocess
